# Plants Analysis Working Group

The Plant Analysis Working Group is comprised of international research scientists and professors working together with a shared goal of developing a central doc

Plant AWG members contributed to analysis pipelines, provided input on standardizing plant metadata terms, beta tested the GeneLab Analysis Platform, and initiated planning for a potential Plant AWG manuscript utilizing GeneLab omics data. Overall, members provided valuable feedback on how the GeneLab team could better serve the broader research community.

The primary goal of the Plant AWG is developing a central document exploring the metadata and scientific findings from spaceflight and ground-based experiments now available through GeneLab. This working group is striving to enhance the visibility and utility of GeneLab and spur new collaborations to develop the fundamental and applied knowledge to enable long-term spaceflight and ground-based advances to agriculture.

The Plant Analysis Working Group is comprised of international research scientists and professors that meets regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in AstroBotany – the discipline of botany concerned with interactions between plant biology and space environment. The group’s meta-analysis research focused on the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis to spaceflight and the integration of epigenetics, proteomics, and glycomic datasets to make predictions and guide future research into the metabolic response of crops in orbit.
